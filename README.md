## Gift Exchange Effort Timing - Data Visualization:

This project contains my replication code for the data analysis of my solo-authored paper "Effort Timing and Reciprocity in the Gift Exchange," which I created using Python and R. The vast majority of the analysis uses python, so the R file is barebones.

Inside the main folder, you will find my Python replication file "Gift Exchange Data Analysis.py", the R replication file, "stats.R", as well as the aggregate tables.

Inside the "After After" and "Effort Before" folders, you will find the summary statistics and a wage-effort relation table for each individual session. 

The data is omitted because the paper has not been published, yet. To give you an idea of the data structure, each session subfolder has an excel file named "Transactions.xlsx". In addition, I export a compiled data set named "r\_data.csv", which is also omitted.

If you would like a copy of the working paper, please feel free to contact me. I am more than happy to share my work.
